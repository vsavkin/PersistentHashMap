PersistentHashMap implements Map interface and adds two additional operations to it.
reread() - reads a hash map from a file.
flush() - saves a hash map to a file.

All operations are thread safe.

Basic use case:
def map = new PersistentHashMap(file)
map['key'] = 'value'
map.flush()

It uses objectStream under the hood. As a result all the objects must implement Serializable to be saved.
